This repo will use modified version of [morph027/apt-repo-action](https://github.com/xlionjuan/apt-repo-action) and [xlionjuan/fedora-createrepo-image](https://github.com/xlionjuan/fedora-createrepo-image) to create repo, and deploy to GitHub Pages.

The `.sh` script is written by ChatGPT, it will fetch the release data from GitHub API and use [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) to parse JSON data and find the asset URL.
